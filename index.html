    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a data engineer and machine learning enthusiast with experience building scalable data pipelines, developing business intelligence reports, and creating datasets to support advanced analytics and ML models. At work, I have designed and maintained dynamic reports using SAP WebI, Power BI, Incorta, and Excel Power Query. Academically, I have built regression, graph-based, and LLM-powered models, including extracting entities from Reddit to create public datasets. I enjoy combining data engineering, analytics, and machine learning to deliver actionable insights and efficient solutions.
